<h1 align="center">Pinterest Auto Poster Bot</h1>

## Project Overview:

This project is designed to automate Pinterest posting for marketers, bloggers, and e-commerce brands who want consistent, scheduled pinning without manual work. It tackles the challenge of Pinterest’s strict anti-spam policies by mimicking natural human behavior, using randomized schedules, and integrating advanced fingerprint spoofing. Ideal for growing brand presence, boosting traffic, and maintaining a regular content calendar—without risking immediate bans.


## Core Features:
- **Stealth Posting:** Mimics human posting intervals and activity to avoid detection.
- **Advanced Proxy Management:** Handles IP rotation to reduce risk of mass banning.
- **Flexible Scheduling:** Supports bulk scheduling and content planning to automate campaigns effectively.
